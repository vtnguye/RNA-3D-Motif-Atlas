# RNA 3D Motif Atlas

The RNA 3D Motif Atlas is a new online database that provides an automated classification of internal and hairpin loop RNA 3D motifs. 

## Method

The method uses a representative set of internal and hairpin loops extracted from a nonredundant list of RNA-containing PDB files and compares their structures geometrically using the FR3D program suite. The loops are then clustered into motif groups, taking into account geometric similarity and structural annotations.

## Availability

The database is updated every four weeks and provides an interactive user interface for exploring motif diversity and tools for programmatic data access. 

## Website

The website for the RNA 3D Motif Atlas is http://rna.bgsu.edu/motifs
